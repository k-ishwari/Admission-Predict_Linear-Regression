# Admission-Predict_Linear-Regression

Problem Statement - For one who want to pursue their postgraduate studies, it would be difficult for them to find out what college they may join, based on their GPA, Quants, Verbal, TOEFL and AWA Scores. People may apply to many universities that look for candidates with a higher score set, instead of applying to universities at which they have a chance of getting into.

Objective: To build a Linear Regression model that can help students to pick the right universities based on their profiles.
